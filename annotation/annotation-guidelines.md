# Metalinguistic Disagreement Detection Study: Annotation Guidelines

## Overview
Your task is to review 20 pairs of Wikipedia page summaries and related statements. For each pair, you will determine if you disagree with the statement and, if so, whether your disagreement is factual or metalinguistic in nature.

## Key Definitions
1. **Factual Disagreement**: A disagreement about what is actually true in the world.
2. **Metalinguistic Disagreement**: A disagreement about the meaning or use of words, rather than about facts or ideas.

## Annotation Process
For each of the 20 summary-statement pairs:

1. Read the Wikipedia page summary carefully.
2. Read the related statement generated from the Wikidata knowledge graph.
3. Decide if you disagree with the statement.
4. If you disagree, determine whether your disagreement is factual or metalinguistic.

## Making Your Judgment
Follow these steps to make your judgment:

1. **Do you disagree with the statement?**
   - If you agree with the statement or find it accurate, mark it as "Agree" and move to the next pair.
   - If you disagree, proceed to step 2.

2. **Is your disagreement factual or metalinguistic?**
   - Ask yourself: "Am I disagreeing with the facts presented, or with how the words are being used or defined?"
   
   a) **Factual Disagreement**:
      - You believe the statement is incorrect based on the facts presented in the Wikipedia summary or your own knowledge.
      - Example: The statement says "The Eiffel Tower is located in London," but you know it's in Paris.
   
   b) **Metalinguistic Disagreement**:
      - You disagree with how a term is being used or defined, not with the underlying facts.
      - Example: The statement refers to a tomato as a vegetable, but you believe it should be classified as a fruit.

## Examples to Guide Your Decision

1. **Factual Disagreement**:
   - Summary: "Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on Earth, standing at 8,848 meters."
   - Statement: "Mount Everest has a height of 8,850 meters."
   - Judgment: Factual disagreement (the heights don't match)

2. **Metalinguistic Disagreement**:
   - Summary: "Pluto was once considered the ninth planet but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006."
   - Statement: "Pluto is a planet in our solar system."
   - Judgment: Metalinguistic disagreement (disagreement about the definition of "planet")

3. **No Disagreement**:
   - Summary: "The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states."
   - Statement: "The Great Wall of China is a fortification in China."
   - Judgment: Agree (no disagreement)

## Important Notes
- Focus on the content of the summary and statement, not on grammar or writing style.
- If you're unsure, re-read the summary and statement carefully before making your decision.
- Your personal knowledge can inform your judgment, but prioritize the information given in the Wikipedia summary.
- If a statement contains multiple claims, disagree if any part of it is problematic.
- Be consistent in your approach across all 20 pairs.

Remember, your contributions are valuable for advancing our understanding of how language models interpret and disagree about meaning. Thank you for your careful consideration of each pair!
