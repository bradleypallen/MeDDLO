# Metalinguistic Disagreement Detection Study: Information Sheet

## Study Purpose
This study aims to create a benchmark dataset for detecting metalinguistic disagreements in LLM-based fact-checking. Your participation will help advance our understanding of how language models interpret and disagree about meaning in knowledge graph engineering contexts.

## What Participation Involves
If you choose to participate, you will:
1. Read a set of annotation guidelines
2. Review 20 pairs of Wikipedia page summaries and related statements
3. For each pair, indicate if you disagree with the statement
4. If you disagree, specify whether it's due to factual inaccuracy or differences in term interpretation

The task will be conducted entirely online using a web interface generated by Potato, an open-source annotation tool. The estimated time commitment is [X] minutes/hours.

## Data Collection and Confidentiality
- All data will be collected anonymously. You will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information.
- Your responses will be assigned a unique identifier that cannot be traced back to you.
- The data collected will be used solely for research purposes and may be included in academic publications or presentations. However, no individual responses will be identifiable.

## Risks and Benefits
- Risks: This study involves minimal risk. You may experience minor fatigue from screen use or mental effort during the annotation task.
- Benefits: While there are no direct personal benefits, your participation contributes to advancing research in natural language processing and knowledge engineering.

## Voluntary Participation and Right to Withdraw
- Your participation is entirely voluntary.
- You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason.
- If you wish to withdraw your data after completing the study, you may do so by contacting the research team with your unique identifier up until [specific date or event, e.g., "two weeks after your participation" or "before the data analysis phase begins on DATE"].
