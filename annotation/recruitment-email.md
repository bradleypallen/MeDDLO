Subject: Invitation to Participate in Metalinguistic Disagreement Detection Study

Dear Student,

We are conducting a research project at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Informatics and are seeking undergraduate and masters students to participate in an annotation task. This study aims to create a benchmark dataset for metalinguistic disagreement detection in the context of the use of large language models for knowledge graph engineering.

As a participant, you would be asked to:
1. Review 20 pairs of Wikipedia page summaries and related statements
2. Indicate whether you disagree with each statement
3. If you disagree, specify whether your disagreement is based on the fact of the statement or on the meaning of the one or more of the terms used in the statement

The task will be conducted entirely online and should take approximately 45 minutes to complete.

If you're interested in participating or have any questions, please reply to this email. We will then provide you with a detailed information sheet and consent form.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to contribute to our research.

Best regards,
