Subject: Invitation to Participate in Metalinguistic Disagreement Detection Study

Dear Student,

We are conducting a research project at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Informatics and are seeking undergraduate and masters students to participate in an annotation task. This study aims to create a benchmark dataset for metalinguistic disagreement detection in the context of LLM-based fact-checking.

As a participant, you would be asked to:
1. Review 20 pairs of Wikipedia page summaries and related statements
2. Indicate whether you disagree with each statement
3. If you disagree, specify whether it's due to factual inaccuracy or differences in term interpretation

The task will be conducted entirely online and should take approximately [estimated time] to complete.

If you're interested in participating or have any questions, please reply to this email. We will then provide you with a detailed information sheet and consent form.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to contribute to our research.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position/Department]
University of Amsterdam
